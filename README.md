- Hi, I’m @Valence101
- I’m interested in coding! Expanding my knowledge of new stacks! Poking around different frameworks!
- I’m currently learning python and diving deeper into nodejs backends and custom http listeners!
- I have been coding for a decade now, mostly C#, HTML, CSS web development. For the past two years I've been coding infrastructure as code using HashiCorp terraform to deploy and manage AWS cloud infrastructure.
- I’m looking to collaborate on ??? I'm not sure, I am an open-source noob on the lookout for something that strikes my passions of micro-biology, psychology, crypto-currency and deflationary systems!
